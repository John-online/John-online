# Hey, I'm **Scarlot Ruskipy**! 👋

I'm a **17 year old full-stack developer** who's been playing with code for a long time now. I'm always open to connecting with people who share the same passion for tech, creativity, and just being real.

I've never liked school much (not gonna sugarcoat it), but I've always loved **learning on my own**, especially when it involves **code**, or just figuring out how things work. I'm the kind of person who'll spend hours fixing something I broke just to understand why it broke in the first place.

I care way more about **people than profit**. I'm not a fan of greedy companies or people who put money over everything. To me, making something that helps others or even just makes someone smile matters way more than making a quick buck.

### 🧠 A Little Background

I've been working as a **full-stack dev** for about **5-6 years**, and coding in general for **over 8 years**. It all started with simple stuff like Roblox and Scratch, and now I build everything from websites and bots to FiveM resources and random side projects that sometimes go way too far. 😄

I'm really into building tools especially the weird, niche, or “why does this exist?” kind of tools because half the fun is in the learning.
